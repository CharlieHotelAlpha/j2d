This is a remake of the bastos85 engine, based on the experience I got
using unity3d. It is written in java for portability, and for OOP. Not using
a OOP language for Bastos85 was definitely a major mistake ! 

It uses the lwjgl library, so you need to install it before trying to run
anything

Unless specified otherwise, everything in the math,engine and 
org packages are under the WTFPL.
Unless specified otherwise, everything in game is for your eyes only. 
Feel free to use it as an example of how to do your game tough ! But
chances are that it will quickly be too big to be that good of an example.

TODO
====

The engine uses several architecture tricks that are not very obvious, and
the documentation is inexistant. Documentation will be added when the code
maturity improves.
